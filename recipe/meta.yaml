  summary: Bmad is an object oriented, open source, subroutine library for relativistic charged-particle dynamics simulations in accelerators and storage rings.
  description: |
    Bmad has been developed at Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary
    Particle Physics and has been in use since the mid 1990s.
    Bmad has a wide range of routines to do many things.
    Bmad can be used to study both single and multi-particle
    beam dynamics. It has routines to track both particles and
    macroparticles. Bmad has various tracking algorithms including
    Runge-Kutta and symplectic (Lie algebraic) integration.
    Wakefields, and radiation excitation and damping can be simulated.
    Bmad has routines for calculating transfer matrices, emittances,
    Twiss parameters, dispersion, coupling, etc.
