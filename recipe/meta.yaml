  summary: Bmad is an object oriented, open source, subroutine library for relativistic charged-particle dynamics simulations in accelerators and storage rings.
  description: |
    Bmad has been developed at Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary
    Particle Physics and has been in use since the mid 1990s. Bmad has a wide range
    of routines to do many things. Bmad can be used to study both single and
    multi-particle beam dynamics. It has routines to track both particles and
    macroparticles. Bmad has various tracking algorithms including Runge-Kutta and
    symplectic (Lie algebraic) integration. Wakefields, and radiation excitation
    and damping can be simulated. Bmad has routines for calculating transfer
    matrices, emittances, Twiss parameters, dispersion, coupling, etc.
